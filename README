This is Joe's Own Editor.  See the INFO file if you don't know what this is.

A preformatted man page is in joe.man.  Joe.1 is an nroff formatted man
page.

Installation proceedure
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Edit the Makefile to change the following options:

	  Where joe's keymap initialization files, global termcap file and
	  terminfo source file will go if not /usr/local/lib.

	  Where joe will be placed when you do 'make install'
	  if not /usr/local/bin.

	  Where joe's man page will be placed, if not /usr/man/man1.

	  If you want to use the terminfo database instead of termcap.

	  Some systems require a few other changes (notably Xenix).  Check
	  out the comments in the Makefile.

	Type 'make' to create joe.  You can then try it by typing ./joe.

	Then log into root and type 'make install' to install joe.

	Type 'make clean' eliminate the .o files

	Set the baud rate properly (see below).

	See special notes below for dealing with broken terminals.

	See special notes below for 'JPICO'

	See special notes below for using joe within shell scripts.

	If you want 8-bit characters to get through, you will have to play
	with your stty settings:

	On Posix/SysV try this command: stty -istrip -iexten -inpck

USEAGE:	joe filenames

	Optionally preceed each filename with +nnn to start at specified 
line number.  

  Options:

 -mid		Cursor is recentered when scrolling is necessary
 -marking	Text between ^KB and cursor is highlighted (use with -lightoff)
 -asis		Characters 128 - 255 shown as-is
 -force		Force final newline when files are saved
 -nobackups	If you don't want backup files to be created
 -lightoff	Turn off highlighting after block copy or move
 -exask		^KX always confirms file name
 -beep		Beep on errors and when cursor goes past extremes
 -nosta		Disable top-most status line
 -keepup	%k and %c status line escape sequences updated frequently
 -pg nnn	No. lines to keep for PgUp/PgDn
 -csmode	^KF after a pervious search does a ^L instead
 -backpath path Directory to store backup files
 -nonotice	Disable copyright notice
 -noxon		Attempt to turn off ^S/^Q processing
 -orphan	Put extra files given on command line in orphaned buffers
		instead of in windows
 -dopadding	Output pad characters (for when there is no tty handshaking)
 -lines nnn	Set no. screen lines
 -baud nnn	Set baud rate for terminal optimizations
 -columns nnn	Set no. screen columns
 -help		Start with help on
 -skiptop nnn	Don't use top nnn lines of the screen

  Options before each file name:

 -wordwrap		Wordwrap
 -autoindent		Auto indent
 -overwrite		Overtype mode
 -lmargin nnn		Left margin
 -rmargin nnn		Right margin
 -tab nnn		Tab width
 -indentc nnn		Indentation character (32 for space, 9 for tab)
 -istep nnn		Number of indentation columns
 -french		One space after '.', '?' and '!' for wordwrap
			and paragraph reformat instead of two.  Joe
			does not change the spacing you give, but
			sometimes it must put spacing in itself.  This
			selects how much is inserted.
 -spaces		TAB inserts spaces instead of tabs.
 -linums		Enable line numbers on each line
 -rdonly		File is read-only
 -crlf			File is uses CR-LF at ends of lines (MS-DOS files)

	These options can also be set in the joerc file.  The NOXON, LINES,
COLUMNS, DOPADDING and BAUD options can also be set with environment
variables.

	The JOETERM environment variable can be set to override the TERM
environment variable.

** IMPORTANT **

The baud rate must be correctly set or either typeahead will not interrupt 
the screen update and scrolling wont be used or there will be annoying 
delays in the screen update.  If you can't set the baud rate correctly with 
'stty', give a numeric value in the environment variable 'BAUD' or to the
command line options '-baud'.

The baud rate '38400' or 'extb' means infinite to joe.  Use it for X windows
and hardware console ttys.  No delays will be generated and scrolling will
not be used.

The baud rate '19200' or 'exta' means that joe will use scrolling, but will
not delay.

Use the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables or the -lines and -columns
command line options if you need the terminal size to be different than
whatever the termcap entry or stty reports.

Since most people use terminal emulators, JOE does not send out pad 
characters.  If you're using a real terminal and the padding matters, set 
the environment variable DOPADDING or give the command line option
-dopadding.

If you want joe to try to disable ^S/^Q processing, set the environment
variable NOXON or command line option -noxon.

A termcap file is included with JOE.  You might consider updating your own 
termcap file with the entries in it, particularly if you use ANSI/VT100ish 
terminals.  JOE understands some capabilities which are not usually supplied 
in normal termcap (see below).

                                 VARIATIONS
                                 =-=-=-=-=-

Termcap/Terminfo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	JOE prefers to use the termcap terminal capability database.  It
attempts to find this file in:

	$HOME/.termcap		Personal .termcap in your home directory
	/usr/local/lib/termcap	Joe's termcap file
	/etc/termcap		Normal system termcap file

	Joe coppies its own termcap file to /usr/local/lib/termcap (or
wherever the system-wide joerc file is going to go) when 'make install' is
run.

	Termcap is better than terminfo because it is a more open standard. 
Programs can directly access the termcap database and future versions of
terminfo may require programs to use curses.  The only argument in
terminfo's favour is that it is faster than termcap.  To fix this problem,
JOE will use a termcap index file if it exists and if it is up to date.

	This is the proceedure to make the termcap index file:

		make termidx
		./termidx </etc/termcap >/etc/termcap.idx

	The /etc/termcap.idx is a text file which you can look at if you're
curious.

	JOE supports the GNU extensions to the termcap language and also
understands several new capabilities:

		AL DL IC DC RI LE UP DO SF SR

			Versions of the standard capabilities which accept
			an argument.  For example, RI with and argument of
			7 should move the cursor 7 positions to the right.

		rr

			Set this flag if the cursor is restricted to move
			only within the scrolling regions.  This is an optional
			mode on vt220s and several clones assume that this
			mode is always on.

		cV

			Like the 'cv' capability, but the cursor goes to the
			beginning of the specified line.  Like 'ESC [ n H' in
			ansi/vt100.

	But if you really must use the terminfo database see the
instructions in the Makefile.  Also a terminfo version of the included
termcap file is provided, in case you want it added to the terminfo database
with 'tic'.

VOID trouble
=-=-=-=-=-=-

	If you're using an old C compiler which doesn't like the 'void'
type, uncomment the '#define void int' line from the config.h file.

JPICO
=-=-=

If you want JPICO to act more like real pico when you hit ^X (I.E., to have
it ask before saving), change the line:

exsave		^X		Exit

to:

ask,query,lose,query,abortbuf	^X	Exit

BROKEN TERMINALS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
"Joe does not update the screen correctly in Procomm"
"My Xenix console does not scroll correctly"

Old versions of Procomm, many other DOS comm programs and nearly every
PC-UNIX console (with the exception of Linux) does not emulate VT100s
properly.  There are usually one or more problems:

	1) Tabs are destructive

	2) Tabs are destructive when inverse mode is set

	3) Scrolling regions are not supported

	4) Cursor positioning is scrolling region relative instead of
	   screen relative.

	5) Some other program set the tab-stops to something other than
	   one tab stop every 8 columns.

	6) The erase commands (ESC [ J and ESC [ K) fill with inverse
	   video blanks instead of plain blanks when inverse mode is set.

	7) Backspace is destructive

Procomm 2.3 works fine- but make sure you have DEC VT100 selected, not 'ANSI
BBS' and also that backspace (BS) is set to 'non-destructive'.  If you must
use an old version of Procomm, try using the 'ansisys' or 'nansisys' termcap
entry.  Unix consoles usually do not have scrolling regions, but instead
have insert and delete line commands.  The 'fansi' entry and ones derived
from it will work correctly.  These termcap entries are provided in the
termcap file which came with joe.  If at all possible have your sysadmin
install these entries in '/etc/termcap'.  Even if your system normally uses
the terminfo database, you can copy Joe's termcap file into
/etc/termcap.

"I don't have root access and can't update the system's termcap file.  How
 do I get only Joe to use a different termcap entry?"

"My system uses terminfo.  How do I get only Joe to use a different termcap
 entry?"

What you should do is copy the termcap file which is provided with joe into
'.termcap' of your home directory.  Now suppose you want Joe to use the
'fansi' termcap entry:

If you use csh or tcsh, place this in your .cshrc file:

	setenv JOETERM fansi

If you use sh, ksh or bash, place this in your .profile file:

	JOETERM=fansi; export JOETERM

"I don't have root access and can't update the system's termcap file.  How
 do I get all of my programs to use one of Joe's termcap entries?"

Again, copy termcap into '.termcap' in your home directory, but set the
environment variables like this:

	setenv TERMCAP $HOME/.termcap
	setenv TERM fansi

"My system uses terminfo... how do I get all of my programs to use one of
 Joe's termcap entries?"

First, compile joe for terminfo.  You then have to 'tic' the terminfo
version of joe's termcap file into your account.  These are the commands for
doing this:

	1)	cd
	2)	mkdir .info
	3)	setenv TERMINFO $HOME/.info

		(or

		TERMINFO=$HOME/.info; export TERMINFO

		if you use bash, sh or ksh)

	4)	tic joe/terminfo

Then put the 'setenv TERMINFO $HOME/.info' line into your .login file or
'TERMINFO=$HOME/.info; export TERMINFO' in your .profile.  Now all of your
programs should look up the 'TERM' in your own personal terminfo database.

USING JOE IN A SHELL SCRIPT
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Joe used to use /dev/tty to access the terminal.  This caused a problem with
idle-session killers (they would kill joe because the real tty device was
not being accessed for a long time), so now joe only uses /dev/tty if you
need to pipe a file into joe, as in:  echo "hi" | joe -

If you want to use joe in a shell script which has its stdin/stdout
redirected, but you don't need to do 'joe -', you should simply redirect
joe's stdin/stdout to /dev/tty:

	joe filename  </dev/tty >/dev/tty
