Here is 'J', which is not the first version of "E" released on the net, but
is pretty close.  It shows the result of some critical influence from people
on the net.  This version has:

* gap buffer

* K&R C, because it was more portable.

* multiple windows

* ~ expansion of file names

* A man page! (complete with embarrassing spelling errors :)

* Compile with 'make cruddy'.

* Still only works in 80x24 terminal

* Undelete

Here is the original README file:



If you don't know what this is, read the NEWS file.

To compile:

	(1) Determine where you want to install the editor program and the
	    system default keymap file.  Put this path in the Makefile.  If
	    you're a mere user, don't worry about this.  Instead, place a copy
	    of the 'keymap.j' file (created after you make) in your home
	    directory.

	(2) type 'make xenix' for xenix systems, 'make hpux' for hpux systems
	    or 'make bsd' for BSD systems.  If none of these work, type
	    'make cruddy' to make a version with an inferior terminal driver.

	(3) To install it in the system, log in as superuser and do
	    'make install'
