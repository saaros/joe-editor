Here is the last version before the big joe1.0 rewrite.  It got the be quite
sophisticated.  It now has macros and a real undo system.


--> original README file



If you don't know what this is, read the INFO file.

To compile:

	(1) Determine where you want to install the editor program and the
	    system default keymap file.  Put this path in the Makefile.  If
	    you're a mere user, don't worry about this.  Instead, place a copy
	    of the '.joerc' file in your home directory.

	(2) If you need to be able to display characters with bit 7 set as-
	    is (instead of in inverse), comment out the '#define NOHIGHBIT'
	    line in the file 'joe.h'

	(3) type 'make xenix' for Xenix systems, 'make hpux' for HPUX systems
	    or 'make bsd' for BSD systems, 'make posix' for AIX systems or
	    'make esix' for esix systems.  If none of these work, type 'make
	    linux' or 'make cruddy' to make a version with an inferior
	    terminal driver (The linux version is for system V systems
	    without timers or asynchronous ttys.  Cruddy is for systems which
	    don't even have a termio structure).

	(4) To install it in the system, log in as superuser and do
	    'make install'

	(5) When JOE is used, be sure the baud rate as reported by stty is
	    correctly set.  If you're not on a real serial terminal, try to
	    set the baud rate to the best guess of what the actual throughput
	    is.  In particular, if you use JOE on a windowing system, the
	    window updates will be much faster if you set the baud rate to
	    'extb' or '38400'.

	(6) PC users may wish to change the line 'backs   ^?' in the .joerc
	    file to 'delch    ^?'.  This way, the Del key deletes characters
	    instead of backspacing.
