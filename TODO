Short (infinite) list for 3.2:

- - - - - - - -

Problems with parsing joerc file: comments are getting included in all
string options.  Switch to unix standard config file format?

Make joerc file so we load system and local customizations.

- - - - - - - -

perl again: if (-s foo)  looks like s/

- - - - - - - -

formatting characters are being interpreted by context printing on status
line

- - - - - - - -

can we highlight backup files? files ending in .in?

- - - - - - - -

read only doesn't work when there's a process running in the window.
(it probably shouldn't run).

- - - - - - - -

  define characters which make up words
    There are some A-Zs in tomatch (should use i18n).

- - - - - - - -

- merge math with macro language
- tab at math prompt should go through variables, functions.
- eliminate need for : separator

  improve macros: ignore error option, pass args to here option.

jmacs:

 many negative args do not work properly because args
 are not passed to target command in a macro.

 some macros are broken because of the bail on any error
 semantic: sometimes we want to ignore errors (emacs scroll
 other window when we hit end of window).

- - - - - - - -

    - Reload modified files (or current window)
      (can be a macro: ^KE name rtn)

- - - - - - - -

- update man page

- - - - - - - -

- search: automatically use 'k' mode if there is a block selected?  Cursor should
  jump to top of block when done?  Modes for this?

- - - - - - - -
  exemac for first change: it should be run with cursor in window.

  -orphan will break -mnew, -mold macros (because macros are run without a
window on the screen).

- - - - - - - -

- egmont's Ctrl-selection bug

- - - - - - - -

- better string demarcation in highlighter (highlight all words with 's in
  them- need to use pointers instead of buffer to refer to string)

- - - - - - - -

- .joe_state file:
 - save names of files on command line?
 - try for previous screen configuration?
 - multiple joes: the last one who exits wins
 - don't quote macros, so user can copy them to joerc file

- turn on by default?

- - - - - - - -

More colors: UI for using 256 color xterms.
  - Problems: tgoto takes only two params, so we have to switch to tparm.

- - - - - - - -

Completion list build could take a long time

- - - - - - - -

Others:

- completion list of internal commands brings up documentation

- keep special meaning of !, >> and , in file names?

- rectangular blocks: make this a local file option?

- security hole with spell checker

- regexp for compiler parsing

- shell window intercept should be smarter.  hit ^K ^H- the ^H is going to the
  shell window.

- do not use ^[^[ for anything.  it prevents Alt-arrow
  from being useful.

- save all files without asking thing for quick compile

- continued search mode for jpico?

- make ^K F prompt with previous text (PICO)?

options are screwed up: we copy window to buffer (to get buffer options
to the buffer).  But if we have multiple windows, buffer options will have
stale data.

we are missing many query and prompt window abort handlers, which cause
small memory leaks.

regex: character classes? a-z matches any letter?

parse *rc file only once?

can't load terminfo- should switch to termcap or provide compiled
ANSI terminfo built in.

gettext patch

Perl compatible regex search.

Improvements for regular text
-----------------------------
mode where wordwrap wraps rest of paragraph?

mode where all editing wraps rest of paragraph?

Improvements for programming
----------------------------
Jump to definition (tags does this)

Show list of references

Diff mode (need vertical window)

Tie in with CVS

Refactoring

Syntax Highlighting:
--------------------

Fix for next release highlight:

  other windows why
  lose state during page down?


Support for more languages:

 Paragraph reformat mode for TeX files.

 Reformat paragraph should reformat C function if we're editing C.

File loading/storing:

 Unnamed buffers should be in bufed list (was fixed in the lost joe 2.9)

Jmacs:

 search and replace 'fred' to 'foo':
    find 'Fred', gets 'Foo'.

 Rectangle mode for emacs yank system

 Overtype mode works for yank

 ESC args should work differently in emacs

 exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
 (it isn't in emacs either)

Shell windows:

 Better environment settings for shell windows.

Documentation:

 Include documentation for joe hackers.  I wrote a lot of this
 some time, I need to find it.

 joe should open tty earlier in startup sequence because ^Y
 is suspend character on sun.

UTF-8/Internationalization
--------------------------

byte to byte conversions?
UTF-8 decoder right at input instead of in qw and utype?

UTF-8 syntax files?

- right-left mode for Hebrew/Arabic?

  There is no good way to do this.  For all rtol, you could use a reversed
xterm.  For mixed, you need tags to indicate direction.



Use memory mapped files to fast load large files.  Have to not
count no. lines in each buffer on startup.

Emulate other editors?  Brief, EDT?  CUA?


Prompts:

 Sort should be column wise, not row wise?

 HTML-style thing for option selection?



Terminal handling:

 Emit ESC c to reset terminal on startup?

 Look into clearing right-most column.

Mouse:

 ` and autoindent mode are a problem for drag and drop.
 any way we can distinguish normal typing from a drop?
 modify xterm...

Major new modes:

 Hex edit mode

 Fixed record length mode


Major code improvements:

 Vertical windows (optionally lock-stepped).


Major new features:

 Folding


Options

 Fix it so all options appear in ^T.  Maybe make hook function
 to handle major changes.  Need this for major mode change for
 hex edit mode.

Other requests:

 -cleanup (delete extra lines and extra spaces at ends of lines).

 -show no. utf characters, not no. bytes
