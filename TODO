UTF-8/Internationalization
--------------------------

- think about status line, prompts, regex, rc files, highlighting, ug

- check for incorrect pgetc() binsc() pairs.

- check paragraph reformat

- 32-bit chars in search/replace \[...] sequences?

- deal with error utf8 sequences: prget and pgetc do not match.

- deal with error utf8 sequences: no way to print control characters which
  began the sequence.

- when first char of utf8 is last of line, nothing shows on screen (state
  machine never gets any input).

- interaction with -asis (-utf8 should override it).



- translate for non-utf8 locale to utf8 (in and out)

- right-left mode for Hebrew/Arabic?

- Gettext?

--- we have converted from char to unsigned char, so normal characters are
in the range 0 - 255 and EOF is -1 when assigned to an int.  In a UTF-8
terminal we'll have 0 - MAXINT.  Unfortunately we used >=256 for X key
sequences.  We need to change these to <-2 to not collide with UTF-8 chars.
Yuck.  From uisrch.c:

Detect control character and stop incremental search:

	} else if (c >= 0 && c < 32 || c >= 256) {	/* c >= 256 means an X windows sequence like .ku */
		/* Done when a control character is received */

(but we will never get a key >=256: we should only get encoded utf-8
sequence: perhaps all of this is ok).

Syntax Highlighting:
--------------------

More syntax files.

Recognize more file types (joerc work).

Update other *rc files.

Subdirectory for syntax file (understand autoconf/automake).

UTF-8 syntax files.

UI for changing colors in the editor (or at least dark/light mode)


Support for more languages:

 Paragraph reformat mode for TeX files.

 ^G Matching for verilog begin ... end, html tags, etc.

 Add .v, .pl, etc. file types to joerc

 Reformat paragraph should reformat C function if we're editing C.


File loading/storing:

 Reload modified files

 Lock files being edited
  one person gets write lock

 Save all modified

 On save, should check if file on disk is newer

 Should have switch buffers in current window as more fundamental joe key
 sequence.

 should ignore wordwrap when overtype mode is enabled.  they
 interact very badly together.

 joe a b c
 windows are not in order a, b, c

 Unnamed buffers should be in bufed list (was fixed in the lost joe 2.9)

 Don't understand:  optionally break hardlinks on save?  what is "tla"?

 Save all history buffers in .joestate file?

 Use memory mapped files to fast load large files.  Have to not
 count no. lines in each buffer on startup.


Jmacs/Jstar/Jpico:

 Jmacs: incremental search should wrap

 Emulate other editors?  Brief, EDT?

 Rectangle mode for emacs yank system

 Overtype mode works for yank

 Query save loop? for kill-emacs and compile

 Emacs reload from file function? ^X ^V 
 (it just works out if ^X ^V kills all instances of the buffer)

 ESC args should work differently in emacs

 nextword,nextword,prevword sequence 
 doesn't work for marking next successive word at ends of lines

 exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
 (it isn't in emacs either)

Abbreviations

 Tab complete a word in a file, should look through file for matching
 words.


Shell windows:

 Better environment settings for shell windows.


Documentation:

 Update man page.

 Include documentation for joe hackers.  I wrote a lot of this
 some time, I need to find it.


Prompts:

 Make tab completion more like bash?
 Tab character cycle through names like in vim
 ^D in vim shows whole directory

 Sort should be column wide, not row wise.

 Size of file selection window should be an option

 HTML-style thing for option selection


Terminal handling:

 Emit ESC c to reset terminal on startup?

 Look into clearing right-most column.

 joe should open tty earlier in startup sequence because ^Y
 is suspend character on sun.


Math mode:

 Expand math mode (hex, octal, math functions...)


Macros:

 Interactive macros during file load are broken.  Think about multiple
 stack hack (otherwise template based C++ callbacks).


Mouse:

 ` and autoindent mode are a problem for drag and drop.
 any way we can distinguish normal typing from a drop?
 modify xterm...


Keyboard:

 Ctrl-left arrow, etc. give codes in modern Lini- should somehow make
 use of these.


Regex:

 Perl compatible regex search.


Major new modes:

 Hex edit mode

 Fixed record length mode

 Picture mode (can type past right column).


Major code improvements:

 Vertical windows


Major new features:

 Folding


Compiling

 Make it work better:
   remove dead windows
   detect errors better
