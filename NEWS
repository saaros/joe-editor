Release 0.0.0 of 'J' (Joe's Editor):  This release supersedes all previous
versions which lack a release number.  Note that this program was previously
called 'E' but the name has been changed ('E' turns out to be one of the
synonyms for 'vi').  See below for list of bug fixes and new features.  The
2 following posts contain the source.

Introduction

	'J' is a small screen editor which was designed to be easy to use for
novice users but also to be powerful and complete enough for experienced
users.  Several elements of its design are unique innovations.  Here is a
copy of the on-line help text to give you a feel for this editor:

GO TO              DELETE    MISC      BLOCK    FIND     QUOTE    WINDOW
^B left  ^F right ^D single ^T  mode   ^KB mark ^KF text `  Ctrl  ^KO split
^Z word  ^X word  ^W >word  ^R  retype ^KK end  ^L  next ^\ bit-7 ^KI 1 / all
^A edge  ^E edge  ^O word<  ^KA center ^KC copy ^KL line FILE     ^KP up
^P up    ^N down  ^J >line  ^KJ format ^KM move EXIT     ^KD save ^KN down
^U page  ^V page  ^Y line   ^KZ shell  ^KW save ^KX save ^KR read ^KG grow
^KU top ^KV end   ^K- undo  ^K, indnt< ^KY kill ^C abort/         ^KT shrink
^G matching ([<{` ^K+ redo  ^K. indnt>             close window  ^KE get file

Other relevent features:

	* Extremely small - the XENIX version is only 58K

	* Help text can be left on while editing

	* Key layout designed to eliminate headaches: ^Q and ^S are not used,
	  both ^H and DEL are backspace.  Also, each user may customize
	  his key layout by modifying a simple initialization file

	* Versions for BSD, HPUX and XENIX 386 are included.  A simple tty
	  driver is also provided to ease porting to other systems

	* Currently only VT100/ANSI terminals are supported.  If the terminal
	  has scrolling regions, J uses them.  Has well-tuned interruptable
	  screen update algorithm

	* Has: autoindent, word-wrap, overtype/insert, picture mode (right-
	  arrow makes space past ends of lines), right margin (for paragraph
	  formatting and center), and magic tabs (the column number of text
	  after tab stops is preserved when inserting and deleting)

	* The cursor column doesn't 'jump' when you move between long and
	  short lines.  Instead the cursor column only jumps when you try to
	  edit in an invalid place or if picture mode is set, the invalid
	  place is made real by space filling

	* Editor modes can be set depending on file extension

	* No line length restrictions.  Binary files can be edited without
	  difficulty

	* Long lines are truncated, not wrapped (I.E., the screen scrolls to
	  the right to get to the truncated parts)

FIXES FOR THIS VERSION

	* Shell escape lock-ups are fixed

	* Paragraph reformat glitch is fixed

	* Cursor update screwynesses fixed for picture mode

	* Goto next word/Goto previous word/Delete word left and Delete word
	  right were made more consistant

NEW FEATURES FOR THIS VERSION

	* ~ can be used at file name prompts to expand user home directories

	* J now has undelete and redelete (you can go backwards and forewards
	  through the delete buffer to select which text you want to undelete)

	* J now has indent functions.  A marked block can be indented more
	  or less. If you use an indent function outside a marked block, the
	  lines with the same or greater indent level surrounding the cursor
	  are marked

	* Right margin was added for paragraph format and center line

	* Goto matching parenthasis (or [ { ` < )

	* ` was made the quote control character key because ^_ is not easy
	  generate on many keyboard.  `` gets `

	* tty drivers were rewritten.  This made the screen update faster
	  (now the screen update is instantaneous on 20MHz 386s).  Screen
	  update preempting also works better

THE PLAN

	Version 1.0.0 will be a complete rewrite.  It should be done sometime
before january.  These are my goals for it:

	* Block oriented software virtual memory support (for less thrashing
	  and elimination of file size limits caused by the system's process
	  size limit)

	* MS-DOS support

	* X windows support

	* Better integration with UNIX:  J will be able to process text
	  through pipes (like vi), will have standard unix regular expressions,
	  and will be usable as a 'more' program.

	* Will be terminal independant and use termcap and terminfo

	* Will have a ASCII/HEX dump display mode

	* Will have complete program developement support (save&make, next
	  error/previous error, tags file support)

	* Will have a much more powerful scrolling algorithm.  I have a
	  methode which is simpler and faster than even GNU-EMACS' Gosling
	  algorithm

	* All of this will require no changes to the basic keyboard layout-
	  maybe one more added line of help text for new things

	* It will probably have keyboard macros but it won't have much of
	  an extension language.  Maybe in version 2.0.0

	* I expect all of this not to add more than 30 or 40% to the size
