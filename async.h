/* For Best operation:
 *
 *    acheck  returns true if the user typed ahead
 *
 *    acheck  should sleep (nap) for number*(10000/baud) milliseconds
 *            immediately after its fflush(stdout) call.  Number is
 *            the number of characters the call to fflush(stdout)
 *            wrote.
 *
 *    aopen & aclose should not loose any typeahead when they change modes
 *
 * For example:  see the async*.c files
 */

/* For O.K. operation:
 *
 *    acheck  always returns 0 (false).  If acheck is going to do this, don't
 *            even have it fflush(stdout).
 *
 *    aopen & aclose do system("/bin/stty ...."); so they invariably loose
 *                   any typeahead
 *
 * For example: see the cruddy.c file
